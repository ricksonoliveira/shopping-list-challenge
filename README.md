# ShoppingList

ShoppingList is a pure elixir handmade challenge proposed by [Stone](https://www.stone.com.br/), with the purpose to fully distribute the values of a given shopping list between the list's buyers.

## Installation

To use this service, you'll need [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) installed on your machine or container.

Then, install the dependencies with the command:
* `mix deps.get`.

And that's it... you're all set! :smile:
